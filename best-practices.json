      "description": "The root account is the most privileged user in an AWS account. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a username and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS website, they will be prompted for their username and password as well as for an authentication code from their AWS MFA device.\nWhen virtual MFA is used for root accounts, it is recommended that the device used is NOT a personal device, but rather a dedicated mobile device (tablet or phone) that is managed to be kept charged and secured independent of any individual personal devices. ('non-personal virtual MFA') This lessens the risks of losing access to the MFA due to  device loss, device trade-in or if the individual owning the device is no longer employed at the company.\nEnabling MFA provides increased security for console access as it requires the authenticating principal to possess a device that emits a time-sensitive key and have knowledge of a credential.\nNote: Government cloud accounts do not have a root user, and so, should exclude this rule in the CloudGuard UI -> Posture Management -> Exclusions -> Create New Exclusion (for each relevant ruleset)",

You cannot manage MFA devices for the root account using other credentials.\n1. Login to AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/\n2. Choose Dashboard, and under Security Status, expand Activate MFA on your root account\n3. Choose Activate MFA\n4. In the wizard, choose A hardware MFA device and then choose Next Step\n5. In the Serial Number box, enter the serial number that is found on the back of the MFA device\n6. In the Authentication Code 1 box, enter the six-digit number displayed by the MFA device. You might need to press the button on the front of the device to display the number\n7. Wait 30 seconds while the device refreshes the code, and then enter the next six-digit number into the Authentication Code 2 box. You might need to press the button on the front of the device again to display the second number\n8. Choose Next Step. The MFA device is now associated with the AWS account. The next time you use your AWS account credentials to sign in, you must type a code from the hardware MFA device.\n\nVirtual MFA:\nNote: to manage MFA devices for the root AWS account, you must use your root account credentials to sign in to AWS.

Choose Dashboard, and under Security Status, expand Activate MFA on your root account\n3. Choose Activate MFA\n4. In the wizard, choose A virtual MFA device and then choose Next Step\n5. IAM generates and displays configuration information for the virtual MFA device, including a QR code graphic. The graphic is a representation of the 'secret configuration key' that is available for manual entry on devices that do not support QR codes\n6. Open your virtual MFA application. (For a list of apps that you can use for hosting virtual MFA devices, see Virtual MFA Applications.) If the virtual MFA application supports multiple accounts (multiple virtual MFA devices), choose the option to create a new account (a new virtual MFA device)\n7. Determine whether the MFA app supports QR codes, and then do one of the following:\n- Use the app to scan the QR code. For example, you might choose the camera icon or choose an option similar to Scan code, and then use the device's camera to scan the code\n- In the Manage MFA Device wizard, choose Show secret key for manual configuration, and then type the secret configuration key into your MFA application\nWhen you are finished, the virtual MFA device starts generating one-time passwords\n8. In the Manage MFA Device wizard, in the Authentication Code 1 box, type the one time password that currently appears in the virtual MFA device. Wait up to 30 seconds for the device to generate a new one-time password. Then type the second one-time password into the Authentication Code 2 box.

      "remediation": "\n**From Portal**\nEMR versions 4.8.0 and later, supports the use of security configuration to specify settings for encrypting data at rest, data in transit, or both. When you enable at-rest data encryption, you can choose to encrypt EMRFS data in Amazon S3, data in local disks, or both. Each security configuration that you create is stored in Amazon EMR rather than in the cluster configuration, so you can easily reuse a configuration to specify data encryption settings whenever you create a cluster.\n\nFollowing are the steps to create a Security Configuration using the AWS console:\n1. Open the Amazon EMR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/emr.\n2. In the navigation pane, choose Security Configurations, Create security configuration.\n3. Type a Name for the security configuration.\n4. Choose options for Encryption and Authentication as described in the sections below and then choose Create.\n\n**From TF**\n1.

Use following terraform code to create a new EMR clusters.\nNote: we use EOF in terraform code to pass the json format without escaping it with /  or /n /r\n```\nresource \"aws_emr_cluster\" \"cluster\" {\nname          = \"example_name\"\nrelease_label = \"EMR_RELEASE_VERSION\"\napplications  = [\"Spark\"]\n\nadditional_info = EOF\n{\n\"instanceAwsClientConfiguration\": {\n\"proxyPort\": 8099,\n\"proxyHost\": \"my-proxy.example.com\"\n}\n}\nEOF\n```\n\n**From Command Line**\n1. Use below create-security-configuration command to create a security configuration.\na. For SECURITY_CONFIG_NAME, specify the name of the security configuration. This is the name you specify when you create a cluster that uses this security configuration.\nb. For SEC_CONFIG_DEF, specify an inline JSON structure or the path to a local JSON file, such as file://MySecConfig.json. The JSON parameters define options for Encryption, IAM Roles for EMRFS access to Amazon S3, and Authentication as described in the sections below.\n\n```\naws emr create-security-configuration --name SECURITY_CONFIG_NAME --security-configuration SEC_CONFIG_DEF\n```\n\n2. Use below create-cluster command to create a new cluster.\n```\naws emr create-cluster --release-label EMR_RELEASE_VERSION --instance-type VALUE --instance-count VALUE\n```\nNote: --instance-count parameter, the cluster consists of a single master node running on the EC2 instance type specified. When used together with --instance-count , one instance is used for the master node, and the remainder are used for the core node type.\n\n**References**\n1. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-create-security-configuration.html\n2. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-data-encryption-options.html\n3. https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/emr_security_configuration\n4. https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/emr_cluster\n5. https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/emr/create-cluster.html\n6. https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/emr/create-security-configuration.html ",

Select the right version of the Elasticsearch engine from the Elasticsearch version dropdown list.\nc. Click Next to continue the setup process.\n8. On the Configure cluster page, set the new domain parameters using the configuration details copied previously and click Next to continue.\n9. Perform the following actions on the Set up access page of the new domain.\na. Inside Network configuration section, choose VPC access option to launch the domain within a VPC, then select the VPC identifier from the VPC dropdown list, an available subnet from the Subnet list and security groups.\nb. Under Access policy section, paste the access policy copied details into the Add or edit the access policy box or simply select a pre-configured policy from the Set the domain access policy to dropdown list and edit it to meet the needs of your ES domain.\nc. Click Next to continue the process.\n10. On the Review page, verify the domain configuration and its access policy.\n11. Click Confirm and create to launch the new AWS Elasticsearch domain within the specified VPC.\n12. Once the new AWS ES domain is created, upload the data from the source cluster to the new cluster.\n13. Now it is safe to remove the publicly accessible domain.\n14. Perform the following to delete the source domain.\na. Click on the name of the domain that you want to remove.\nb. On the selected domain description page, click Delete Elasticsearch domain to expand the section panel then click Delete domain button to start the removal process.\nc. Under Delete domain dialog box, check Delete the domain then click the Delete button to confirm the action.\n\n**From Command Line:**\n1. Run following command to relaunch the selected Amazon Elasticsearch domain into an AWS VPCs.\n```\naws es create-elasticsearch-domain --region region_name --domain-name Elasticsearch_domain_name --elasticsearch-version version_number --elasticsearch-cluster-config InstanceType=elasticsearch_instance_type,InstanceCount=value --ebs-options EBSEnabled=true,VolumeType=standard,VolumeSize=value --vpc-options SubnetIds=subnet_ID,SecurityGroupIds=sg_ID\n```\n2.Upload the existing data to the newly created cluster. You can remove the old publicly accessible Elasticsearch domain once all the data is uploaded. Use following command to delete the domain.\n```\naws es delete-elasticsearch-domain --region region_name --domain-name Elasticsearch_domain_name\n```\n\nReferences:\n1.  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-vpc.html#es-prerequisites-vpc-endpoints\n2. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-vpc.html#es-creating-vpc\n3. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-vpc.html#es-migrating-public-to-vpc\n4. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/gsgcreate-domain.html\n5. https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/es/create-elasticsearch-domain.html ",

Read-Only\nFull Protection provides the CloudGuard administrator with full control of AWS security policy definition, access leases, and can interact with dynamic policy objects.\n\nIn Full Protection mode, you can manage an AWS Security Group only through CloudGuard. CloudGuard detects attempts to change a security group from the AWS environment (such as the AWS console), which starts Tamper Protection and can send an alert/notification. CloudGuard overrides the change that is made and reverts to the definition of the Security Group defined in CloudGuard. The alerts and notifications initiated from Tamper Protection occur when you start Full Protection for the necessary regions in your cloud account. CloudGuard locks down the configuration of the security groups in that region to make sure that the security group stays correctly configured.\n\nTo make a change in a Security Group that has Tamper Protection enabled, the change is made in CloudGuard. Use following steps to configure a Security Group that has Tamper Protection enabled.\n1. Navigate to the Security Groups page in the Network Security menu.\n2. Select the Security Group to be modified.\n3. Make the necessary changes to the Security Group (for example, add or change Inbound or Outbound services).\n4.

An SSM managed instance has the SSM Agent installed and running, and has an attached AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) instance profile that allows SSM to manage the instance. If you are already using SSM to manage your instances, no additional steps are needed for Amazon Inspector to begin scans.\nUse following steps to configure an Amazon EC2 instance for Amazon Inspector scanning.\n\n1. Configure SSM for an Amazon EC2 instance. If it is not already installed by your operating system vendor, install the SSM Agent. Follow reference section for more details.\n2. Use the AWS CLI to verify that the SSM Agent is running. Follow reference section for more information.\n3. Grant permission for SSM to manage your instance. You grant permission by creating an IAM instance profile and attaching it to your instance. If you do not already have an IAM instance profile role for SSM, create an IAM instance profile for Systems Manager. After you create the instance profile, you must attach it to your instance.

Create a metric filter based on filter pattern provided which checks for AWS Management Console sign-in without MFA and the cloudtrail_log_group_name. Use following command:\n```\naws logs put-metric-filter --log-group-name cloudtrail_log_group_name --filter-name no_mfa_console_signin_metric --metric-transformations metricName= no_mfa_console_signin_metric ,metricNamespace=METRIC_NAMESPACE,metricValue=1 --filter-pattern '{ ($.eventName = ConsoleLogin) && ($.additionalEventData.MFAUsed != Yes) }'\n```\nNote: You can use below command to reduce false positives incase Single Sign-On (SSO) is used in organization:\n```\naws logs put-metric-filter --log-group-name cloudtrail_log_group_name --filter-name  no_mfa_console_signin_metric --metric-transformations metricName= no_mfa_console_signin_metric ,metricNamespace=METRIC_NAMESPACE,metricValue=1 --filter-pattern '{ ($.eventName = ConsoleLogin) && ($.additionalEventData.MFAUsed != Yes) && ($.userIdentity.type = IAMUser) && ($.responseElements.ConsoleLogin = Success) }'\n```\nNote: You can choose your own metricName and metricNamespace strings. Using the same metricNamespace for all Foundations Benchmark metrics will group them together.\n\n2. Create an SNS topic that the alarm will notify\n```\naws sns create-topic --name sns_topic_name\n```\nNote: you can execute this command once and then re-use the same topic for all monitoring alarms.\n\n3. Create an SNS subscription to the topic created in step 2\n```\naws sns subscribe --topic-arn sns_topic_arn --protocol protocol_for_sns --notification-endpoint sns_subscription_endpoints\n```\nNote: you can execute this command once and then re-use the SNS subscription for all monitoring alarms.\n\n4.

In the Manage MFA Device wizard, choose A virtual MFA device, and then choose Next Step.\nNote: IAM generates and displays configuration information for the virtual MFA device, including a QR code graphic. The graphic is a representation of the 'secret configuration key' that is available for manual entry on devices that do not support QR codes.\n6. Open your virtual MFA application. (For a list of apps that you can use for hosting virtual MFA devices, see Virtual MFA Applications.) If the virtual MFA application supports multiple accounts (multiple virtual MFA devices), choose the option to create a new account (a new virtual MFA device).\n7. Determine whether the MFA app supports QR codes, and then do one of the following:\n7.1 Use the app to scan the QR code. For example, you might choose the camera icon or choose an option similar to Scan code, and then use the device's camera to scan the code.\n7.2 In the Manage MFA Device wizard, choose Show secret key for manual configuration, and then type the secret configuration key into your MFA application. When you are finished, the virtual MFA device starts generating one-time passwords.\n8. In the Manage MFA Device wizard, in the Authentication Code 1 box, type the one-time password that currently appears in the virtual MFA device. Wait up to 30 seconds for the device to generate a new one-time password. Then type the second one-time password into the Authentication Code 2 box.

You can copy any security group from EC2-Classic to your VPC that meets the requirements. Default security groups cannot be deleted and will be removed on your behalf when EC2-Classic is retired. You can only copy security group rules to a new security group in the same AWS account in the same Region. If you are using a different Region or a different AWS account, you must create a new security group and manually add the rules yourself. For more information, see Amazon EC2 security groups for Linux instances.\n\nPrerequisites: Before you begin copying your security groups, you should check for rules in which your EC2-Classic security groups reference another security group in EC2-Classic. You should remove these rules as they can't be copied into a VPC. For more information, see Delete rules from a security group.\n\nUse following steps to copy your security group rules to a new security group\n1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.\n2. In the navigation pane, choose Security Groups.\n3. Select the security group that's associated with your EC2-Classic instance, then choose Actions, and select Copy to new security group.\n4.

Under Inbound rules, the fields are populated with the rules from your EC2-Classic security group. You can modify the rules as required. Under Outbound rules, a rule that allows all outbound traffic has automatically been created for you. For more information about modifying security group rules, see Amazon EC2 security groups for Linux instances.\nImportant: You must remove any rules that reference a security group in EC2-Classic, because you can't reference an EC2-Classic security group from a VPC security group. You can add similar rules after you copy the security group to your VPC.\n6. Choose Create security group.\n\n**From Command Line:**\n1.

To Delete all inline policies that are associated with the role, perform the following:\na. Use the following command to list all policies that are in the role:\n```\naws iam list-role-policies --role-name example_role_name\n```\nb. Use the following command for each policy to delete each policy from the role.\n```\naws iam delete-role-policy --role-name example_role_name --policy-name ec2-list-policy\n```\n3.
